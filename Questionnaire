1) Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?

I have used react bootstrap to implement UI to save time. It doesn't affect the perfomance much but looks more 'generic'. Also there could be a cleaner way to fetch data from API,
perhaps  dynamically, but I but I have not worked with React and API's recently and didn't know on top of my head the optimal way.

2) Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)

I didnt have much time so I do not think I have overdesigned anything. 

3) If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?

Usually I would say we could try using caching but since cryptomarket never closes, that would not benefit much, so I am not sure how else we could optimize perfomance. 

4) What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementatio

Perhaps I could add a function that reloads the data every minute or so becuase at the moment the information will not be updated unless you refresh the page.
I would also research a bit more about different sources because the prices at Coinbase and Gemini seem too different and they always favor Gemini, which makes me wonder
why would people buy from Coinbase and what do I not undrstand about this market. Also, the page looks boring, adding some style would be nice :)
